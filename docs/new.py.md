|------------|------|--------|
| None | – | The module contains no imports or external references. |

> **Note:** Because the module has no `depends_on` entries in the provided evidence, it does not rely on any other part of the codebase.

---

## Usage

| Downstream Module | Interaction | Role |

## Extending `new.py`

If you plan to add functionality, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Add a proper docstring** at the module level to describe its purpose.
2. **Declare any imports** at the top of the file.
3. **Define functions or classes** that encapsulate the desired behavior.
4. **Update the `depends_on` and `used_by` metadata** accordingly so that documentation tools can reflect the new relationships.
